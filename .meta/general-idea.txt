Manokit is an easy-to-use, powerful and hopefully fully native e-mail sending client, that simplifies everything

It must simplify the whole process to just a handful of function calls and it must be straight-forward

It can:
    - Send simple plain-text emails via SimpleEmail class (w/ attachments)
    - Send emails containing HTML elements via HTMLEmail class (w/ attachments)
    - Interpolate email's subject and body to make it more customizable

It supports:
    - Multiple recepients
    - Multiple attachments
    - All stages of standart email sending process in Python (but simplified)
